Data Quality Engine

DataQualityEngine
Data Quality Engine DQE is a set of routines designed to run on the SQL Server platform.
The DQE is designed as a SSIS, Master Data Services, SQL Agent and T-SQL based solution. The DQE gives you a centralised and metadata driven mechanism for managing your data profiling, validation and cleansing activities.
The DQE is simply called as a Stored Procedure and can be used at any stage in the ETL process as well as providing support for multi-step activities.
DQE has been designed to
• Centralise data quality rules into a single repository 
• Provide a user interface to allow technically-oriented users to manage rules 
• Provide a flexible mechanism for invoking the data quality rules such that it can be easily be called at multiple points within an ETL flow 
• Capture the results of past tests and keep a record of failed DQ tests DQE implements around 30 different types of cleansing, validation and profiling rule which fall into six broad categories:
  • Value Correction Rules 
  • Expression Rules 
  • Reference Rules 
  • Harmonisation Rules
  • Profiling Rules 
  • Transformation Rules 
We have designed the DQE to be completely open source and highly configurable which allows you to fine tune the solution to your environment
